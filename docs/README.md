# DDoS Testing Script

**Disclaimer:** This script is intended strictly for authorized testing purposes. Unauthorized usage against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical.
## Overview

This project is a Python-based DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) testing script designed to evaluate the resilience of web applications by simulating high volumes of traffic. It's a powerful tool for penetration testers and cybersecurity professionals to assess the strength of their infrastructure.
## Features

- **Private IP Spoofing:** Randomly generates private IP addresses, simulating attacks from multiple sources.
- **Multithreading:** Leverages multithreading to maximize the intensity of the simulated attack while optimizing resource usage.
- **Configurable Packet Count:** Customize the number of packets sent, allowing fine-tuned control over the testing intensity.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. The script also requires the `aiohttp` library.

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

``` bash
python ddos_test.py --target-ip <target_ip> --port <target_port> --packets <packet_count>
```

Replace <target_ip>, <target_port>, and <packet_count> with your desired target IP, port number, and the number of packets to send, respectively.

 ## Example
```bash
python ddos_test.py --target-ip 192.168.1.1 --port 80 --packets 1000
```
This command will send 1000 packets to the target IP 192.168.1.1 on port 80.

## Important Considerations

- **Legal Compliance:** Ensure you have explicit permission to test the target system. Unauthorized testing is illegal.
- **Ethical Use:** Use this script responsibly. It is designed for security professionals and penetration testers conducting authorized testing.
